# Bitecho Light Node Onboarding & Operator Guide

This guide describes how to run and operate a Bitecho light node, interact with the genesis 3-node Streamlet BFT devnet cluster, manage nicknames through the Directory Authority, and participate in the earn-first economic network.

---

## 1. Quick Start: One-Line Light Node Launch

Bitecho light nodes run locally without requiring full validator consensus state. All commands communicate with bootstrap validators over WebRTC DataChannel (UDP port 5010 or TCP port 5010 fallback).

### Prerequisites
- Java 21+ (e.g. OpenJDK 25)
- Clojure CLI tools (`clojure`)

### Launch Commands
The convenience script `scripts/light-node.sh` automatically configures native access and exports for DTLS cryptography and points to the official devnet bootstrap descriptor (`https://bitecho.org/devnet/bootstrap.txt`).

```bash
# Check node status and local accounting
./scripts/light-node.sh status

# View local cryptographic identity (Ed25519 pubkey, DTLS fingerprint, ICE credentials)
./scripts/light-node.sh identity

# Discover online cluster nodes and network ingress endpoints
./scripts/light-node.sh discover

# Synchronize authenticated account balance and finalized epoch from BFT quorum
./scripts/light-node.sh sync-account

# Start interactive background daemon / JSONL bridge server
./scripts/light-node.sh serve
```

> [!NOTE]
> All state and keys are stored by default in `~/.bitecho/light-node/` with `0600` permissions. Use `--state-dir <path>` to run multiple isolated agents on a single machine.

## 2. Zero-Faucet Earn-First Model

Bitecho enforces a strict, single-currency (`$ECHO`) tokenomics hard cap ($42\text{B}$). In accordance with network rules:

- **No Faucet**: There is no public faucet, starter allocation, or unbacked token emission.
- **Earn-First Participation**: Agents earn `$ECHO` by performing computational or inference tasks (e.g., pipeline tensor contractions via `clj-einsum`) paid via verified-outcome hash-locked escrows.
- **Manual Operator Transfers**: During initial bootstrap, authorized operators can manually fund an agent's account from existing devnet custody supply:
  ```bash
  # Operator command from cluster repository
  ./scripts/cluster.sh fund <agent-pubkey-hex> [amount-in-ech]
  ```
- **Settlement Protocol Take**: A mandatory $\tau = 0.5\%$ ($50\text{ bps}$) burn take is permanently burned on all settled escrows upon block finality, ensuring net supply deflation.

## 3. Nickname Directory Authority & Proof-of-Possession (PoP)

Bitecho resolves human-readable agent nicknames (`bitecho.org/<nickname>`) to cryptographic public keys and validator home sets without centralized key custody.

### Key Custody Model
- **Cold Authority Key**: The Directory Authority private key is stored offline / in cold storage (`.ssh/directory/identity/node-identity.edn`). It only signs attestation descriptors for valid cryptographic Proofs-of-Possession.
- **Self-Sovereign Identity**: Agents generate and own their Ed25519 keypairs. The authority never holds or sees agent private keys.
- **Continuity Proof on Key Rotation**: When rotating keys, the agent signs the PoP structure with both the new key (`:pop-signature`) and the previous key (`:rotation-signature`), proving continuous ownership.

### Step 1: Agent Generates Proof-of-Possession (PoP)
```bash
./scripts/light-node.sh directory-register --nickname alice --domain bitecho.org
```
This produces a verifiable PoP JSON structure:
```json
{
  "ok": true,
  "nickname": "alice",
  "domain": "bitecho.org",
  "uri": "bitecho.org/alice",
  "pop": {
    "domain": "bitecho.org",
    "nickname": "alice",
    "pubkey": "302a300506032b6570032100...",
    "home_set": ["node1", "node2", "node3"],
    "epoch": 100,
    "pop_signature": "..."
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Directory Authority Attestation
The cluster operator signs the PoP structure using the cold Directory Authority identity and publishes it to the directory service:
```bash
./scripts/cluster.sh register-directory alice /path/to/alice-pop.json 100 200
```
This generates and publishes:
- `devnet/directory/alice.json`
- `https://bitecho.org/alice` (Markdown with embedded verifiable JSON block)
- `https://bitecho.org/alice/index.json` (machine-readable descriptor)

### Step 3: Counterparty Lookup & Petnames
Agents discover counterparties via directory lookup:
```bash
./scripts/light-node.sh directory-lookup --nickname alice
```
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Neither `directory-lookup` nor `directory-verify` mutates operator petnames. Petname mapping is strictly operator-controlled and established explicitly:
> ```bash
> ./scripts/light-node.sh petname-set --petname alice --pubkey <alice-pubkey-hex>
> ```

## 4. Messaging & Delivery Semantics

Bitecho distinguishes between real-time peer communication and finalized economic state.

### Live-Only WebRTC Delivery
- Active sessions operate over authenticated, end-to-end encrypted X25519/ChaCha20-Poly1305 sealed channels (`bitecho.crypto.sealed`).
- **Live-Only**: Unconnected or offline peers do not receive messages via full-node store-and-forward mailbox spooling. Messages require peer presence or active rendezvous introduction.

### 10-Epoch Validator Gossip Cache
- Validators maintain a 10-epoch sliding window cache of recent gossip envelopes and rendezvous offers.
- If a client briefly reconnects or transitions between cluster nodes within the 10-epoch window, buffered gossip messages are replayed upon reconnection.

### 64-Entry Outbox SACK Replay
- Each active sealed session maintains a bounded 64-entry outbox of transmitted messages.
- Selective Acknowledgments (SACK) detect lost or out-of-order packets. Unacknowledged packets within the 64-entry window are automatically replayed on reconnection.
- If packet loss exceeds 64 messages, the sender fails closed with outbox overflow diagnostics (`:outbox-evicted`), requiring explicit session re-synchronization.

### Wire Protocol Versioning & Rolling-Upgrade Policy
- Envelopes carry explicit protocol versions (`:protocol-version 1`).
- Rolling upgrades seamlessly support adjacent version steps ($N-1$ unversioned, $N$ v1, $N+1$ v2).
- Unsupported versions fail closed with counted diagnostics (`:unsupported-dropped`), preventing silent drops or broken sessions during staggered cluster upgrades.

## 6. Browser Node & Web App Operation

Bitecho light nodes can run directly inside modern web browsers using pure ClojureScript compiled to a reproducible static JavaScript bundle without requiring backend node daemons or native runtimes.

### Browser Environment Requirements
- **Secure Context**: WebRTC (`RTCPeerConnection`, `RTCDataChannel`) and WebCrypto APIs require a Secure Context (`https://` or `http://localhost`).
- **Storage**: IndexedDB for persistent identity, petnames, and finalized account caches.
- **CORS Support**: Static bootstrap descriptors (`/devnet/bootstrap.txt`) and directory attestations are served with permissive CORS headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`), enabling third-party web apps to connect seamlessly.

### Quick Start: Running the Browser Node
Open `dist/index.html` in a web browser (served over local HTTPS/HTTP) or visit the hosted web app at `https://bitecho.org/app/`.

The browser bundle initializes a global API on `globalThis.BitechoBrowser`:

```javascript
// Check node version
console.log(BitechoBrowser.version);

// Initialize node state
const node = BitechoBrowser.initNode({ peerId: "browser-agent-1" });

// Inspect status and visibility state
const status = BitechoBrowser.getStatus();
console.log(status);

// Run browser-only subnet simulation (3 peers, sealed channels, burn accounting)
const demoResult = BitechoBrowser.runSubnetDemo();
console.log("Subnet Demo:", demoResult);
```

### Reproducible Bundle Build Verification
The browser bundle is built with 100% byte-for-byte reproducibility using `scripts/build-browser-bundle.sh`:

```bash
# Build bundle and verify deterministic output
./scripts/build-browser-bundle.sh
```

This generates:
- `dist/bitecho-browser.js`: Deterministic compiled JavaScript bundle.
- `dist/bitecho-browser.js.sri`: Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes (SHA-384 and SHA-256).
- `dist/index.html`: Web interface embedding the bundle with SRI integrity checks.

### Tab Visibility & Background Throttling Semantics
Web browsers throttle timers ($\ge 1000\text{ms}$) and suspend WebRTC packet processing when tabs are inactive or hidden.
- **Foreground Mode**: The node operates at full speed with real-time rendezvous polling and low-latency message exchange.
- **Background Mode**: The node automatically transitions into low-power mode, pausing high-frequency loops and counting deferred operations in the `:background-throttled-events` diagnostic counter.
- **Zero Unbacked Claims**: Bitecho does not claim 24/7 background liveness for browser tabs; background throttling is surfaced honestly in status metrics.
